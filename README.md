# SkinC
Skin Cancer detecting app - developed in 2017 and not updated since. My first trial in the Android development world. This app uses Machine learning to effectively detect the skin cancer. As for the backend, Firebase was used due to its performance, security,real time and its currently the most advanced BaaS solution. This app was developed in three months after an extensive reasearch about the skin cancer, patient's diseases and medications that might conflict with the cancer and how to successfully diagnose and treat skin cancer. Patient's can upload a photo of their mole or instead detect by using the camera and seeing the result instantly!
